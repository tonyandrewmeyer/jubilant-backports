# Design goals

We designed Jubilant-backports so it would:

- **Support Juju 2.9** in addition to Juju versions supported by Jubilant.
- **Work as a drop-in replacement for Jubilant.** Simply `import jubilant_backports as jubilant` and the package will figure out the rest.
- **Align with the design goals for Jubilant itself.**
