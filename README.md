# Jubilant-backports, the joyful library for integration-testing charms in Juju 2.9 and above

[Jubilant](https://canonical-jubilant.readthedocs-hosted.com) is a Python library that wraps the [Juju](https://juju.is/) CLI for use in charm integration tests. It provides methods that map 1:1 to Juju CLI commands, but with a type-annotated, Pythonic interface.

Jubilant-backports is a Python library that wraps Jubilant to provide support for running with Juju 2.9. It is a drop-in replacement for Jubilant, using the Jubilant package for Juju 3.0 and above, as well as when there are no differences between 2.9 and higher, and custom code otherwise.

You should consider using Jubilant-backports if you need to run the same charm integration test suite against Juju 2.9 as well as more modern Juju version.

## Using Jubilant-backports

Jubilant-backports is published to PyPI, so you can install and use it with your favorite Python package manager:

```
$ pip install jubilant-backports
# or
$ uv add jubilant-backports
```

Because Jubilant-backports calls the Juju CLI, you'll also need to [install Juju](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/2.9/howto/manage-juju/index.html#install-juju).

To use Jubilant-backports in Python code:

```python
import jubilant_backports as jubilant

juju = jubilant.Juju()
juju.deploy('snappass-test')
juju.wait(jubilant.all_active)

# Or only wait for specific applications:
juju.wait(lambda status: jubilant.all_active(status, 'snappass-test', 'another-app'))
```

Below is an example of a charm integration test. First we define a module-scoped [pytest fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html) named `juju` which creates a temporary model and runs the test with a `Juju` instance pointing at that model. Jubilant-backports's `temp_model` context manager creates the model during test setup and destroys it during teardown:

```python
# conftest.py
import jubilant_backports as jubilant

@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def juju():
    with jubilant.temp_model() as juju:
        yield juju


# test_deploy.py
import jubilant_backports as jubilant

def test_deploy(juju: jubilant.Juju):        # Use the "juju" fixture  # type: ignore
    juju.deploy('snappass-test')             # Deploy the charm
    status = juju.wait(jubilant.all_active)  # Wait till the app and unit are 'active'

    # Hit the Snappass HTTP endpoint to ensure it's up and running.
    address = status.apps['snappass-test'].units['snappass-test/0'].address
    response = requests.get(f'http://{address}:5000/', timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
    assert 'snappass' in response.text.lower()
```

You don't have to use pytest with Jubilant-backports, but it's what we recommend. Pytest's `assert`-based approach is a straight-forward way to write tests, and its fixtures are helpful for structuring setup and teardown.


## Contributing and developing

Anyone can contribute to Jubilant-backports. It's best to start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports/issues) with a clear description of the problem or feature request, but you can also [open a pull request](https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports/pulls) directly.

Jubilant-backports uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies and tools, so you'll need to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) to work on the library. You'll also need `make` to run local development tasks (but you probably have `make` installed already).

After that, clone the Jubilant-backports codebase and use `make all` to run various checks and the unit tests:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports
Cloning into 'jubilant-backports'...
...
$ cd jubilant-backports
$ make all
...
========== 93 passed in 0.81s ==========
```

To contribute a code change, write your fix or feature, add tests and docs, then run `make all` before you push and create a PR. Once you create a PR, GitHub will also run the integration tests, which takes several minutes.


## Doing a release

To create a new release of Jubilant-backports:

1. Update the `__version__` field in [`jubilant_backports/__init__.py`](https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports/blob/main/jubilant_backports/__init__.py) to the new version you want to release.
2. Push up a PR with this change and get it reviewed and merged.
3. Create a [new release](https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports/releases/new) on GitHub with good release notes. The tag should start with a `v`, like `v1.2.3`. Once you've created the release, the [`publish.yaml` workflow](https://github.com/tonyandrewmeyer/jubilant-backports/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml) will automatically publish it to PyPI.
4. Once the publish workflow has finished, check that the new version appears in the [PyPI version history](https://pypi.org/project/jubilant-backports/#history).
